This repo consists of two complimentary parts:

One, code for arduini (or similar micocontrollers) that will drive multiple channels on a string of decorative lights based on commands over a serial connection.

Two, a web page and associated assets that sends commands and recieves status information over a serial connection.

The simplest-case elctronics for this system are very simple. merely three leds connected to an arduino. However, any real use will need a high-ish current driver.
